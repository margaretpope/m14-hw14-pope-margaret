        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Margaret Pope. I was born and in Birmingham, AL. After spending some time outside of the state of Alabama for college and my first job, I moved back to Birmingham in late 2019 to start my current job as an administrative assistant at the Cathedral Church of the Advent. My position there has grown and evolved to now include social media and website maintenance, which is why I became interested in this program: to get a formal education about the things I was learning on the fly at work.</p>
        <p>My favorite hobby, which I picked up right before Covid hit, is needlepointing. My grandmother taught me, and I was immediately addicted. I enjoy getting together with other crafty friends and stitching over a glass of wine. I also like going for walks, listening to audiobooks, and spending time with friends and family.</p>
        <p>My goal is to be able to use my degree to find a full-time communications job, rather than splitting my time between communications and administration like I do now. My hope is that this degree will give me the training and competitive edge I need for that career shift.</p>
